# Full-Stack CRUD Application
## Twitter Clone Web App
Our project is inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> and our goal was to essentially replicate as much of the actual site as feasibly possible. We prioritized ensuring that the user can successfully create, edit, and delete their tweets as well as the overall style of the application itself in order to help foster a sense of familiarity with real Twitter users.

## Technologies Used
HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, MongoDB, Express, and Node.

## Next Steps
- Allow users to add media (pictures, video, etc.) to their tweets.
- Allow users to create and edit their own profile page.
- Allow users to privately message other users.
- Add a light/dark mode to the site.
